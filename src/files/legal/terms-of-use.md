## 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION

We provide through our Website access to and Services in connection with a decentralised protocol on the MultiversX blockchain that allows users to exchange certain compatible cryptoassets (“the Protocol''). Our Website is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol.

To access the Protocol, you must use non-custodial wallet, which allows you to interact with the MultiversX blockchain. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service of that third party, not this Terms. Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with us, and we do not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents.

You agree and understand that our Services are distinct from the Protocol and that Ashswap does not control or operate any version of the Protocol on the MultiversX blockchain. By using our Services, you understand that you are not buying or selling any cryptoassets from us and that we do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol. When traders pay fees for trades, those fees accrue to liquidity providers for the Protocol. As a general matter, Ashswap is not a liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools and liquidity providers are independent third parties. You hereby declare that You fully understand that if You lose your recovery words (and the private keys associated with Your wallet), You will not be able to access Your wallet and Your funds. We do not have access to Your recovery words (and the private keys associated with Your wallet), You are the only one who has access to them.


## 2. THE PROTOCOL

### a. Nature of Protocol

The Protocol is a decentralised protocol on the MultiversX blockchain created to exchange (swap) between different types of cryptoassets and earn rewards by participating in certain types of token staking. The Protocol is intended as a technological tool that may be used as part of your own self-directed virtual asset transaction workflows.

Ashswap is not involved in any transactions, whether as an intermediary, counterparty, advisor or otherwise. In particular, We are not a custodian or a counterparty to any transactions executed by you on the Protocol. We do not support any other service, particularly we do not provide any order matching, guaranteed prices, or similar exchange or trading platform services.

The Protocol is also not part of the Website and is not a Service of Ashswap and does not constitute any element of the Services. We do not control the Protocol and accept no liability for the operation of any of the foregoing. The Protocol continues to evolve through its communities of supporters. We are a member of those communities, and we contribute to the continuing development of the Protocol, including by making available documentation and other tools. But Your use of the Protocol is entirely at your own risk.

### b. Your responsibility for use and compliance

The Protocol is not a service of any kind, and you should not rely on Ashswap to assist you to evaluate the Protocol, assess its fitness for any purpose or comply with any requirements. You assume all risks arising from interactions with the Protocol. Ashswap is not liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of liability, arising from, out of or in connection with the Protocol. Without limitation, you are solely responsible for identifying and complying with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in connection with the use of the Protocol, including with respect to any transactions. Any parameters set by Ashswap are for its own purposes and should not be taken to infer any responsibility of Ashswap for your activities.

### c. Availability of the Protocol

The Protocol is made available via Ashswap web app at[ https://app.ashswap.io](https://app.ashswap.io), but it may not be available at all times. You may also interact with the smart contracts directly without going through the Website. Ashswap is not responsible for ensuring the availability or operation of the Protocol. The Protocol may be interrupted, suspended or restricted, including because of a fault, defect, hack, attack, exploit, error or unforeseen circumstances, at any time.

### d. Risks

Interacting with the Protocol involves significant risks. You must carefully consider all applicable risks and determine whether they are acceptable to you prior to interacting with the Protocol and any other person (including conducting any due diligence you consider necessary in relation to them).

Without limitation, these risks include in particular the following:

1.	Partial or total loss of cryptoassets, or of any value attributed to cryptoassets.
2. Collapse in liquidity with respect to cryptoassets.
3. Changes in the compatibility of cryptoassets with the Protocol.
4. Regulatory uncertainty with respect to cryptoassets, and government action against cryptoassets and persons involved in cryptoassets activities. In particular regulatory uncertainty with regard to decentralised applications.
5. Extreme fluctuations in prevailing fees and uncertainty with respect to other transaction parameters.
6. Various forms of misconduct, including
    i. market manipulation
    ii. trading crypto assets on the basis of non-public information
    iii. front running
    iv. Failure of cryptoassets transactions to be confirmed in a timely manner, or at all.

7. Counterparty risk.
8. Faults, defects, hacks, exploits, errors, or unforeseen circumstances occurring in respect of the Protocol or the technologies on which the Protocol depends.
9. Loss of private keys.
10. Failure or non-availability of the Protocol or technologies on which the Protocol depends, including the Internet, and technological advancement rendering certain technologies obsolete.
11. Attacks on the Protocol or technologies on which the Protocol depends, including:
    i. Distributed denial of service
    ii. sybil attacks
    iii. Phishing
    iv. social engineering
    v. Hacking
    vi. Smurfing
    vii. Malware
    viii. double spending
    ix. majority-mining, consensus-based or other mining attacks
    x. misinformation campaign
    xi. forks; and
    xii. spoofing

## About Ashswap Platform

Ashswap operates the Website and provides a graphical user interface/App and certain Services (the “ Ashswap Platform'') to facilitate you interacting with the Protocol. The main purpose of Ashswap Platform is to offer its Users the possibility to access the Protocol to exchange their cryptoassets and earn staking rewards. In addition, through Ashswap Platform, the Users can also access and view the balance of their crypto assets. The fiat value of User’s Assets as displayed through Ashswap Platform is only an estimate depending on relevant exchange rates of fiat currencies and the valuation of crypto-assets which are constantly changing. We do not warrant nor make any representations as to the accuracy of the fiat value displayed through Ashswap Platform. For the avoidance of any doubt, fiat currency means any currency issued by a central bank of states, such as the US Dollar, Euro, Ron, etc.

The Users access is conditioned to having a wallet with a third-party service provider the Users manage, this being the only way access to the Platform and transaction on the Protocol can take place.

The owner of this Website is based in Liechtenstein. Use of Ashswap Platform may not be available to You, in whole or in part, in certain regions, countries, or jurisdictions. We make no claims that the Websites or any of its content is accessible or appropriate outside of Liechtenstein. Access to the Website may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Website from outside Liechtenstein, You do so on Your own initiative and are therefore responsible for due diligence with local laws.

Ashswap is not a custodian, exchange, broker, financial institution or creditor. Ashswap Platform is intended as a technological tool that may be used as part of users’ own self-directed crypto assets transaction workflows. Ashswap is not involved in any transactions, whether as an intermediary, counterparty, advisor or otherwise.

## 17. ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.**


**Informal Process First**.  You and Ashswap agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Ashswap or any Affiliates, either party will first contact the other party and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation, any court action, after first allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond.  Both you and Ashswap agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration against the other party.


**Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver**.  After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “**Claim**”) relating in any way to  the Ashswap’s services and/or products, including the Services, and any use or access or lack of access thereto, will be resolved by arbitration, including threshold questions of arbitrability of the Claim. You agree that any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered in accordance with the Liechtenstein Arbitration Rules (LIS) of the Liechtenstein Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The seat of the arbitral tribunal will be Vaduz, Liechtenstein and the arbitral proceedings will be conducted in English. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the laws of the Principality of Liechtenstein. **Judgement on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you  are waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.**


**Timeline for Making a Claim**.  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATED TO, THESE TERMS MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE, OR ELSE YOU AGREE THAT SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION WILL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.


**Costs of Arbitration**. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses will be governed by LIS rules. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits


**WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BRING CLASS ACTION AND REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS**. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDING TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, OR CONTROVERSY WILL BE BROUGHT AND CONDUCTED ONLY IN THE RESPECTIVE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS PART OF ANY CLASS (OR PURPORTED CLASS), CONSOLIDATED, MULTIPLE-PLAINTIFF, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING (“**CLASS ACTION**”).  YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION.  YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY FORUM.  IF THE DISPUTE IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMBINE OR AGGREGATE CLAIMS, CONDUCT A CLASS ACTION, OR MAKE AN AWARD TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION.  FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND IT MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS ACTION. 

IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS LIMITED, VOIDED, OR FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THEN, UNLESS THE PARTIES MUTUALLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE PARTIES’ AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING SO LONG AS THE PROCEEDING IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION.   IF A COURT DECIDES THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH ARE DEEMED INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION MUST BE BROUGHT EXCLUSIVE BEFORE THE COMPETENT COURT IN LIECHTENSTEIN.
