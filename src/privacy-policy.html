            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>One of the main priorities of Ashswap AG (‘’Ashswap’’) is the protection of the privacy of all visitors of the Ashswap web app <a href="https://app.ashswap.io">https://app.ashswap.io</a> and <a href="https://ashswap.io">https://ashswap.io</a> website and its sub-domains.</p>
            <p>As We are committed to protecting and respecting Your privacy, the following information will provide You an overview of what happens to Your Personal Data we collect, use, and share in connection with the Ashswap website as well as the purposes we use it. We are aware of the importance of how Personal Data as confidential information are handled and We assure you that We observe all applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”). Unless otherwise indicated, terms used in this Regulation shall have the same meaning as under GDPR.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of Ashswap so when we mention &quot;Ashswap&quot;, &quot;We&quot;, &quot;Us&quot; or &quot;Our&quot; in this Privacy Policy, We are referring to the company Ashswap AG and its related group of undertakings, responsible for processing Your data. When We mention &quot;You&quot; and ‘’Your’’ We are referring to the individual accessing or using services, or the company, or other legal entity on behalf of which such individual is accessing or using the service, as applicable.</p>
            <h2>GENERAL PROVISIONS</h2>
            <p>Ashswap tries to collect and store as little as possible of your personal data, such as first name, last name, street address, date of birth, email address, or IP address.</p>
            <p>Ashswap in particular collects non-identifiable data, such as public on-chain data, and limited off-chain data like device type, browser version, etc. This is to help drive production vision, not track users. - Ashswap endeavours to refine its practices by exploring methods to further protect consumer privacy such as opt-out prompts, migrating to privacy-centric tooling, and deploying proxies to anonymize network traffic. - Users are empowered to explore client-side privacy techniques and tools.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy shall only apply to Our online activities and is valid for any visit to our website with regards to the information that is shared and/or collected by Ashswap. This Privacy Policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via other channels than this website.</p>
            <h2>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h2>
            <p>If you are located in the EEA and if we collect your personal data you have certain rights in relation to your personal data:</p>
            <h3>Right of access and information</h3>
            <p>You have the right to request from us free confirmation of the processing of the data or information in question and to be informed of such data and to receive further information and a copy of the data in accordance with the provisions of the law. The subject of the information is the stored personal data themselves, the origin of the data, their recipients, and the purpose of the data processing (cf. Art. 15 GDPR).</p>
            <h3>Right of rectification</h3>
            <p>You have the right to correct your data when it is inaccurate or incomplete (for example, change your address).</p>
            <h3>Right to cancel or blocking</h3>
            <p>You have the right to demand from us as the responsible party the immediate deletion of the data concerned or, alternatively, to demand that the processing of the data be restricted in accordance with the statutory provisions (cf. Art. 17, 18 GDPR).</p>
            <h3>Right to data transfer</h3>
            <p>You have the right to demand from us that we hand over to you or pass on to third parties the data concerning you which you have made available to us in accordance with the statutory provisions (cf. Art. 20 GDPR). Direct transfer to another responsible party is subject to technical feasibility.</p>
            <h3>Right to object and withdraw your consent</h3>
            <p>You may withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your data. However, we note that this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will of course advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. At any time, you may withdraw your consent or object to the receipt of newsletters and advertising emails, the personalization of advertisements, or the sharing of your data with our partners (except for technical service providers) by email request to <a href="mailto:privacy@ashswap.io">privacy@ashswap.io</a>.</p>
            <p>We will not refuse any requests submitted by you to exercise your rights without a legal reason.</p>
            <p>We will consider all requests to exercise your rights and provide our response without undue delay (and in any event within one month of your request unless we tell you we are entitled to a longer period allowed by applicable law).</p>
            <p>Certain personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, for example if we need to keep using the information to comply with our own legal obligations or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. If an exception applies, we will tell you this when responding to your request.</p>
            <p>We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to any request you make.</p>
            <h2>DATA WE COLLECT</h2>
            <p>Privacy is central to everything we do at the Ashswap. And we've enshrined transparency as one of our Company values. Accordingly, we aspire to be transparent about what little data we do collect. When you interact with the Services, we collect only:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Publicly-available blockchain data.</strong> When you connect your non-custodial blockchain wallet to the Services, we collect and log your publicly-available blockchain address to learn more about your use of the Services and to screen your wallet for any prior illicit activity. We screen your wallet using intelligence provided by leading blockchain analytics providers. Note that blockchain addresses are publicly-available data that are not created or assigned by us or any central party, and by themselves are not personally identifying.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Information from localStorage and other tracking technologies.</strong> We and our third-party services providers may access and collect information from localStorage, mobile deviceID, cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to provide and personalise the Services and features of the Services for you across sessions. For example, we may use this information to remember tokens you import, star, or add to your shopping bag. We may also use this information to learn about your preferences, your use of the Services, and our interactions with you. Information we collect from these technologies may include things such as browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system, device or browser language, and other device information. We group and analyse these user journeys collectively, in the aggregate, to improve our product user experience.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Information from other sources.</strong> We may receive information about your wallet address or transactions made through the Services from our service providers in order to comply with our legal obligations and prevent the use of our Services in connection with fraudulent or other illicit activities.</p>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some features of the Services may require you to directly enter certain personal information about yourself. You may elect not to provide this personal information but doing so may prevent you from using or accessing these features. Personal information that you directly submit through our Services may include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <strong>Survey or usability information.</strong> If you participate in a survey or usability study with us, we will record any biographical information you directly provide to us (for example, your name, email, and job title), the responses you provide to us, and your interactions with the Services.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Correspondence.</strong> We will receive any communications and information you provide directly to us via email, customer support, social media, or another support channel (such as Twitter or Discord), or when you participate in any surveys or questionnaires.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Biographical information.</strong> If you apply for a job with us, we collect all information provided through our Jobs form, including name, email phone, work and immigration status, and any other resume, cover letter, or free form text you include.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you feel that your rights have not been respected after having contacted us, you have the right to make a complaint to the competent supervisory authority. For Liechtenstein, the competent authority is:</p>

            <h3>HOW WE SHARE DATA</h3>
            <p>We may share or disclose the data we collect:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>With service providers. We may share your information with our service providers and vendors to assist us in providing, delivering, and improving the Services. For example, we may share your wallet address with service providers like Infura and Cloudflare to provide technical infrastructure services, your wallet address with blockchain analytics providers to detect, prevent, and mitigate financial crime and other illicit or harmful activities, and your activity on our social media pages with our analytics provider to learn more about you interact with us and the Services.</li>
            <li>To comply with our legal obligations. We may share your data in the course of litigation, regulatory proceedings, compliance measures, and when compelled by subpoena, court order, or other legal procedure. We may also share data when we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to our users, our Company, or others, and to enforce our agreements and policies, including our Terms of Service.</li>
            <li>Safety and Security. We may share data to protect against, investigate, and stop fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity. We may also use it to address security risks, solve potential security issues such as bugs, enforce our agreements, and protect our users, Company, and ecosystem.</li>
            <li>Business changes. We may transfer or share data to another entity in the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, asset or stock sale, or other business transaction.</li>
            <li>With professional advisors, such as auditors, law firms, or accounting firms in our legitimate interests or as required by law.</li>
            <li>With your consent. We may share your information any other time you provide us with your consent to do so.</li>
            <li>When you request us to share certain information with third parties, such as through your use of social media widgets or login integrations.</li>
            <li>We do not share your information with any third parties for any marketing purposes whatsoever.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>TRANSFER OF DATA TO NON-EU COUNTRIES</h2>
            <p>Among other things, We use tools and services of companies domiciled outside the EU. If such tools are active and your personal data is being transferred outside the EAA, We make sure that the transfer is made only to countries that have been declared as offering an adequate level of protection through a European Commission decision (‘Adequacy Decision’). In absence of an Adequacy Decision, appropriate safeguards are in place and asserted by each contractual party.</p>
            <h2>STORAGE DURATION</h2>
            <p>Cookies from Google Analytics are stored for 1 year. Other cookies are stored in the user’s localStorage on their personal device. Ashswap does not delete these localStorage cookies, therefore You are responsible to manually delete them within your web browser.</p>
            <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this Privacy Policy, Your personal data will remain with Us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If You assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, Your data will be deleted, unless We have other legally permissible obligations for storing your personal data; in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these obligations cease to apply.</p>
            <h2>CONTACT FORM</h2>
            <p>If You submit inquiries to Us via Our contact form, the information provided in the contact form as well as any contact information provided therein will be stored by Us in order to handle Your inquiry and in the event that We have further questions.</p>
            <p>The processing of these data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, if Your request is related to the execution of a contract or if it is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on Our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on Your agreement (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this has been requested.</p>
            <p>The information You have entered into the contact form shall remain with Us until you ask Us to eradicate the data, revoke Your consent to the archiving of data or if the purpose for which the information is being archived no longer exists (e.g., after we have concluded Our response to Your inquiry). This shall be without prejudice to any mandatory legal provisions, in particular retention periods.</p>
            <h2>ANALYSIS TOOLS AND ADVERTISING</h2>

            <p>Google Analytics uses so-called cookies. Cookies are text files, which are stored on Your computer and that enable an analysis of the use of the website by users.

            <h3>Google Tag Manager</h3>
