            <h2 id="1-general-introduction">1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>We provide through our Website access to and Services in connection with a decentralised protocol on the MultiversX blockchain that allow users to exchange certain compatible cryptoassets (“the Protocol&#39;&#39;). Our Website is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol.</p>
            <p>To access the Protocol, you must use non-custodial wallet, which allows you to interact with the MultiversX blockchain. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service of that third party, not this Terms. Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with us, and we do not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. </p>
            <p>You agree and understand that our Services are distinct from the Protocol and that Ashswap does not control or operate any version of the Protocol on the MultiversX blockchain. By using our Services, you understand that you are not buying or selling any cryptoassets from us and that we do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol. When traders pay fees for trades, those fees accrue to liquidity providers for the Protocol. As a general matter, Ashswap is not a liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools and liquidity providers are independent third parties. You hereby declare that You fully understand that if You lose your recovery words (and the private keys associated with Your wallet), You will not be able to access Your wallet and Your funds. We do not have access to Your recovery words (and the private keys associated with Your wallet), You are the only one who has access to them.</p>
            <h2 id="2-the-protocol">2. THE PROTOCOL</h2>
            <h3 id="a-nature-of-protocol">a. Nature of Protocol</h3>
            <p>The Protocol is a decentralised protocol on the MultiversX blockchain created to exchange (swap) between different types of crypto assets and earn rewards by participating in certain types of token staking. The Protocol is intended as a technological tool that may be used as part of your own self-directed virtual asset transaction workflows. </p>
            <p>Ashswap is not involved in any transactions, whether as an intermediary, counterparty, advisor or otherwise. In particular, We are not a custodian or a counterparty to any transactions executed by you on the Protocol. We do not support any other service, particularly we do not provide any order matching, guaranteed prices, or similar exchange or trading platform services.</p>
            <p>The Protocol is also not part of the Website and is not a Service of Ashswap and does not constitute any element of the Services. We do not control the Protocol and accept no liability for the operation of any of the foregoing. The Protocol continues to evolve through its communities of supporters. We are a member of those communities, and we contribute to the continuing development of the Protocol, including by making available documentation and other tools. But Your use of the Protocol is entirely at your own risk.</p>
            <h3 id="b-your-responsibility-for-use-and-compliance">b. Your responsibility for use and compliance</h3>
            <p>The Protocol is not a service of any kind and you should not rely on Ashswap to assist you to evaluate the Protocol, assess its fitness for any purpose or comply with any requirements. You assume all risks arising from interactions with the Protocol. Ashswap is not liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of liability, arising from, out of or in connection with the Protocol. Without limitation, you are solely responsible for identifying and complying with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in connection with the use of the Protocol, including with respect to any transactions. Any parameters set by Ashswap are for its own purposes and should not be taken to infer any responsibility of Ashswap for your activities.</p>
            <h3 id="c-availability-of-the-protocol">c. Availability of the Protocol</h3>
            <p>The Protocol is made available via Ashswap web app at <a href="https://app.ashswap.io">https://app.ashswap.io</a>, but it may not be available at all times. You may also interact with the smart contracts directly without going through the Website. Ashswap is not responsible for ensuring the availability or operation of the Protocol. The Protocol may be interrupted, suspended or restricted, including because of a fault, defect, hack, attack, exploit, error or unforeseen circumstances, at any time.</p>
            <h3 id="d-risks">d. Risks</h3>
            <p>Interacting with the Protocol involves significant risks. You must carefully consider all applicable risks, and determine whether they are acceptable to you prior to interacting with the Protocol and any other person (including conducting any due diligence you consider necessary in relation to them).</p>
            <p>Without limitation, these risks include the following:</p>
